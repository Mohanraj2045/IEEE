Simple Linear Regression and Confusion Matrix
This repository contains educational materials and code for understanding and implementing Simple Linear Regression, along with a folder dedicated to the Confusion Matrix. The main focus is on a Jupyter Notebook that explains the Simple Linear Regression process and includes a Pre-Processing Report (PPR) for Linear Regression. Additionally, there's a dataset (work_exp.csv) used in the examples.

Folder Structure
Linear Regression:

Notebook: The Jupyter Notebook (Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb) provides a step-by-step explanation of Simple Linear Regression, along with a detailed Pre-Processing Report (PPR) specific to Linear Regression. The notebook also utilizes the workers.csv dataset for practical examples.
Confusion Matrix:

This folder (Confusion_Matrix/) contains materials related to the Confusion Matrix. It may include code snippets, notebooks, or additional documentation for understanding and implementing Confusion Matrices.

Dataset
The dataset used in the Simple Linear Regression examples is work_exp.csv. This dataset contains relevant information for understanding the linear relationship between variables.
